In this article, the author discusses their change of heart towards GraphQL after six years of use, and presents specific reasons why they now consider it a sub-optimal choice for most use-cases. They acknowledge GraphQL's previous status as a breakthrough technology that improved upon the untyped JSON REST APIs, albeit later presenting drawbacks, particularly when applied to performance, security, and maintainability. 

The main criticisms towards GraphQL highlighted in the article include attack surface exposure, complexity of rate limiting and authorization, performance issues related to data fetching, and problems with N+1. The author also talks about the increased complexity that comes with using GraphQL, especially when it comes to maintaining and testing a mature GraphQL codebase.

Moreover, the article criticizes GraphQL for encouraging a codebase where business logic is merged with the transport layer, increasing code complexity. Lastly, the poor handling of breaking changes, reliance on HTTP response codes, and observed adverse effects on response times due to HTTP 2+ are additionally listed as drawbacks. 

As a conclusion, the author suggests alternatives to GraphQL, primarily advocating for OpenAPI 3.0+ compliant JSON REST API, indicating that modern tooling in this area has greatly improved, offering a simpler and more streamlined solution, without compromising the attractive qualities that made GraphQL appealing in the first place.
